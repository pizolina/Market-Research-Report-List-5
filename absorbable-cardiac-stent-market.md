<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Absorbable Cardiac Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymer</li><li>Bomaterials</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Absorbable cardiac stents are medical devices used to treat coronary artery diseases. They are available in two main types: polymer and bioresorbable materials. </p><p>Polymer stents are made from synthetic materials that gradually break down in the body over time, allowing the vessel to heal naturally. </p><p>On the other hand, bioresorbable stents are made from natural materials that completely dissolve in the body after a certain period, leaving behind only healed tissue.</p><p>Both types of stents offer advantages in terms of reducing long-term complications and improving patient outcomes in comparison to traditional metal stents.</p></p>
