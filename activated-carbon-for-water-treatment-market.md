<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Activated Carbon for Water Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Powder</li><li>Particles</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Activated carbon for water treatment comes in two main forms: powder and particles. Powdered activated carbon is finely ground and is commonly used in applications where a large surface area is needed for the adsorption of contaminants in water. On the other hand, activated carbon particles are larger in size and are typically used in fixed-bed filters for the removal of impurities from water. Both forms of activated carbon are effective in treating water, but their usage depends on the specific requirements of the treatment process.</p></p>
