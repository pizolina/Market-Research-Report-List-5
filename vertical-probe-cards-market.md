<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vertical Probe Cards Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>MEMS Vertical Probe Cards</li><li>Non-MEMS Vertical Probe Cards</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vertical probe cards are used in semiconductor testing for contacting an array of tiny pads on a semiconductor wafer. MEMS vertical probe cards utilize Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems technology for precision testing, while non-MEMS vertical probe cards do not utilize this technology. MEMS probe cards are known for offering higher accuracy and reliability due to their miniaturized components and advanced engineering. Non-MEMS probe cards, on the other hand, are more cost-effective but may not provide the same level of precision and efficiency as MEMS cards.</p></p>
