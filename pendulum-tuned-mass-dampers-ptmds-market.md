<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pendulum Tuned Mass Dampers (PTMDs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Pendulum Tuned Mass Dampers</li><li>Active Pendulum Tuned Mass Dampers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pendulum Tuned Mass Dampers (PTMDs) are devices used to reduce structural vibrations in buildings or structures. There are two main types: Passive PTMDs use a freely swinging mass to absorb and dissipate energy, while Active PTMDs use sensors and actuators to actively control the mass and dampen vibrations. The market for Passive PTMDs is more established and widely used, while Active PTMDs are gaining traction for their ability to adjust in real-time to changing vibration levels. Both types are effective in improving structural stability and safety.</p></p>
