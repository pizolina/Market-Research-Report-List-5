<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Exhaust Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Fans</li><li>Axial Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Commercial exhaust fans can be categorized into two main types: centrifugal fans and axial fans. Centrifugal fans use rotating impellers to increase the velocity of the air stream, making them ideal for applications requiring high pressure and low flow rates. Axial fans, on the other hand, use a propeller to move air parallel to the fan shaft, making them well-suited for applications requiring high flow rates and low pressure. Both types of fans are commonly used in commercial settings such as restaurants, manufacturing facilities, and warehouses.</p></p>
