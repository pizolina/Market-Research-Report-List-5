<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intelligent Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Tire Pressure Monitoring</li><li>Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Direct Tire Pressure Monitoring refers to systems that use sensors within the tire to directly monitor the tire pressure and provide real-time data to the driver. This type of monitoring is more accurate and reliable but may be more expensive to implement. Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring, on the other hand, uses the vehicle's existing ABS system to monitor tire pressure by measuring the rotation speed of each wheel. While indirect monitoring is cost-effective, it may be less precise and timely compared to direct monitoring.</p></p>
