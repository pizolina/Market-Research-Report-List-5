<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ESD TVS Diodes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Junction Capacitive Type</li><li>Low Junction Capacitive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>ESD TVS diodes are categorized into two types based on their junction capacitance: high junction capacitive type and low junction capacitive type. High junction capacitive type diodes have a larger capacitance, which provides better ESD protection but may impact signal integrity. On the other hand, low junction capacitive type diodes have a lower capacitance, making them suitable for high-speed data lines where signal integrity is crucial. Both types offer effective protection against electrostatic discharge, tailored to different application requirements.</p></p>
