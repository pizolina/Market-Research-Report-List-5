<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Demulsifying Agent for Crude Oil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil Soluble Demulsifying Agent</li><li>Water Soluble Demulsifying Agent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Demulsifying agents for crude oil are used to separate water from oil, making it easier to process and transport. There are two main types of demulsifying agents: oil soluble and water soluble. Oil soluble demulsifying agents are designed to be mixed directly with the oil, while water soluble demulsifying agents are added to the water in the oil-water mixture. Both types of agents work by breaking down the emulsions formed between water and oil, allowing for efficient separation of the two substances.</p></p>
