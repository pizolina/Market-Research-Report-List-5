<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soluble Coffee Powder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spray-drying</li><li>Freeze-drying</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spray-drying soluble coffee powder is created by spraying a liquid coffee concentrate into hot air where the water evaporates, leaving behind dry coffee particles. This process is cost-effective and results in a fine powder that is easily soluble in hot water. On the other hand, freeze-drying involves freezing the liquid coffee concentrate and then subjecting it to a vacuum environment where the ice sublimates, leaving behind a porous, light and fluffy powder. Freeze-dried coffee typically has a superior aroma and flavor compared to spray-dried coffee.</p></p>
