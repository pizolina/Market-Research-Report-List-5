<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Benchtop Hydrogen Gas Generators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Traditional Alkaline Electrolyzer</li><li>PEM Electrolyzer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Benchtop hydrogen gas generators are commonly available in two main types: traditional alkaline electrolyzers and PEM electrolyzers. Traditional alkaline electrolyzers operate by using an alkaline solution to conduct electricity and split water into hydrogen and oxygen. On the other hand, PEM electrolyzers use a proton exchange membrane to separate hydrogen and oxygen molecules. While both types of generators serve the same purpose of producing hydrogen gas, they differ in their mechanisms of electrolysis and efficiency levels.</p></p>
