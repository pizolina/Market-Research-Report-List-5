<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Single Phase Water Smart Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IC Card</li><li>Non-IC Card</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Industrial Single Phase Water Smart Meter market can be classified into two main types based on their payment method: IC Card and Non-IC Card. IC Card meters require users to pre-load credits onto a smart card which is then inserted into the meter for water usage. Non-IC Card meters do not require a card and typically operate on a post-payment system. Both types offer efficient and accurate water usage monitoring for industrial applications, with IC Card meters providing an extra layer of security and user control.</p></p>
