<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Deep Brain Stimulation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implanted pulse generator</li><li>The lead</li><li>Extension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Deep Brain Stimulation involves the use of three key components: implanted pulse generator, the lead, and extension. The implanted pulse generator is a small device that sends electrical signals to specific areas in the brain to regulate abnormal impulses. The lead is a thin, insulated wire that is surgically placed in the brain to deliver the electrical impulses. The extension is a flexible wire that connects the lead to the pulse generator, allowing for continuous stimulation. These components work together to effectively manage conditions such as Parkinson's disease and essential tremor.</p></p>
