<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sample Preservation Solution Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-inactivated Sample Preservation Solution</li><li>Inactivated Sample Preservation Solution</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sample preservation solution is classified into two types: non-inactivated and inactivated. Non-inactivated solutions are designed to preserve samples without altering their biochemical composition, making them ideal for molecular analysis. On the other hand, inactivated solutions contain chemical agents that inactivate proteins and enzymes, preventing sample degradation. These solutions are commonly used for microbiological studies where live microorganisms need to be preserved. Both types of solutions play a crucial role in maintaining sample integrity and ensuring accurate research outcomes.</p></p>
