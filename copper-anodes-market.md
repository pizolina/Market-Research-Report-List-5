<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Copper Anodes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oxygen-free copper anodes</li><li>Phosphorous copper anodes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Copper anodes are commonly classified into two main types based on their composition: oxygen-free copper anodes and phosphorous copper anodes. Oxygen-free copper anodes have a lower oxygen content, which makes them more suitable for applications where high electrical conductivity is required. On the other hand, phosphorous copper anodes contain a small amount of phosphorous, which helps improve the anode's corrosion resistance. Both types of copper anodes are widely used in various industries for electroplating, metal finishing, and other applications requiring high-quality copper products.</p></p>
