<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrasonic Heat Meters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Integrated Heat Meter</li><li>Split Heat Meter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ultrasonic heat meters come in two main types: integrated heat meters and split heat meters. Integrated heat meters combine the flow sensor and calculator into a single unit, making installation simpler and more cost-effective. Split heat meters, on the other hand, separate the flow sensor from the calculator, allowing for more flexibility in installation options. Both types of meters use ultrasonic technology to measure heat energy consumption accurately and efficiently, making them popular choices in the heating and cooling industry.</p></p>
