<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rectangular Water Bath Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Wall</li><li>Double Wall</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rectangular water baths can be classified into two main types based on their wall structure: single wall and double wall. Single wall water baths are constructed with a single layer of material, typically stainless steel, while double wall water baths have an additional outer layer for better insulation. Single wall water baths are usually more affordable, but may not retain heat as efficiently as double wall water baths, which are known for their improved temperature control and energy efficiency. Both types are commonly used in laboratories for incubation, heating, and sterilization processes.</p></p>
