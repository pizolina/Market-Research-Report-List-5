<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Parallel Twin Screw Extruder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Co-rotating</li><li>Counter-rotating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Parallel twin screw extruders are classified into two main types based on the direction of rotation of the screws: co-rotating and counter-rotating. In co-rotating extruders, both screws rotate in the same direction, allowing for better mixing and conveying of materials. On the other hand, in counter-rotating extruders, the screws rotate in opposite directions, producing more shear and increasing the residence time of the material in the extruder. Both types have their own advantages and are used in various industries for different applications.</p></p>
