<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive AWD Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automatic AWD</li><li>Manual AWD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive AWD systems come in two main types - Automatic AWD and Manual AWD. Automatic AWD systems constantly monitor road conditions and distribute power between the front and rear wheels as needed without any input from the driver. On the other hand, Manual AWD systems require the driver to manually engage the system when needed, giving them more control over when to use additional traction. Both types offer advantages and are suitable for different driving preferences and conditions.</p></p>
