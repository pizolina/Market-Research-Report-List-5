<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Turbines for Ships Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Axis</li><li>Dual Axis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gas turbines for ships are divided into two main market types: single axis and dual axis. Single axis turbines have only one rotor shaft that drives the propeller, providing power for propulsion. On the other hand, dual axis turbines have two rotor shafts, one for propulsion and the other for electricity generation. The single axis market is focused on smaller vessels requiring simpler propulsion systems, while the dual axis market caters to larger ships needing both propulsion and electricity generation capabilities.</p></p>
