<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bifurcation Lesions Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One-Stent</li><li>Two-Stent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bifurcation lesions in the medical market refer to a condition where a blood vessel branches off into two smaller vessels. In the One-Stent market, a single stent is used to treat the lesion, typically placed at the branching point to ensure both vessels are adequately supported. In the Two-Stent market, two stents are used to treat more complex bifurcation lesions, with one stent in each branch to provide sufficient support and maintain proper blood flow. Both markets aim to effectively treat bifurcation lesions and improve patient outcomes.</p></p>
