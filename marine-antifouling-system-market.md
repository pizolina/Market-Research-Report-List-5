<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Antifouling System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ultrasound Antifouling System</li><li>Electrolytic Antifouling System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Marine antifouling systems are designed to prevent the accumulation of marine organisms on ships and underwater structures. There are two main types of antifouling systems: ultrasound antifouling systems and electrolytic antifouling systems. Ultrasound antifouling systems work by emitting high-frequency sound waves that deter marine growth, while electrolytic antifouling systems use low-voltage electrical currents to prevent fouling. Both systems offer effective solutions for maintaining the cleanliness and efficiency of marine vessels and structures.</p></p>
