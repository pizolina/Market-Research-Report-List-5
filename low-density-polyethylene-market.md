<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low Density Polyethylene Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autoclave Process</li><li>Tubular Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) is produced through two main processes: Autoclave Process and Tubular Process. Autoclave Process LDPE is produced in a high-pressure reactor, resulting in higher density and branching of the polymer chains. This type of LDPE is commonly used for films, pipes, and tubing. On the other hand, Tubular Process LDPE is produced in a tubular reactor at lower pressures, resulting in lower density and less branching. This type of LDPE is typically used for packaging, agricultural films, and coatings.</p></p>
